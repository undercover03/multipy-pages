            <p>
                Perth (Nyungar: Boorloo) is the capital and largest city of Western Australia. It is the fourth most populous city in Australia and Oceania, with a population of over 2.2 million (80% of the state's) within Greater Perth. It is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia, with the majority of Perth's metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp. The city has expanded outward from the original British settlements on the Swan River, upon which its central business district and port of Fremantle are situated.
